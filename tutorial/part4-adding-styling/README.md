- Add styling
- Add dynamic styling

Awesome, we now have a fully functioning website! But you're probably looking at it and thinking "I've seen prettier warthogs!" 🐗

Let's fix that.

Frontity uses CSS-in-JS for styling components. This has a number of advantages:

- it only loads the CSS needed for each page which improves the performance
- you don't have to worry about classes and problems with duplication, typos, etc
- you don't have to worry about vendor prefixing so you can write your CSS based on the current standard and Frontity handles the rest for you
- you can use all the power of JavaScript to style your components and create dynamic styles with much less code
