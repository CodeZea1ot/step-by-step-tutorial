# Getting help and support

The documentation should be your first port of call when you need to check how something works, or when you get stuck.

If you can't find the answer to your problem in the documentation then you can ask in the [Frontity community forum](https://community.frontity.org/). There you will find members of the Frontity team and knowledgable members of the community who will be happy to help out and offer you support.

This is also a forum that you can give back to. If you know the answer to someone else's question do please help them out. That, after all, is how communities get built - through mutual help and support.

Other support resources such as Reddit or stackoverflow don't have a large number of Frontity users on them at this time. By all means try them, but the quickest way to get your questions answered is in the [Frontity community forum](https://community.frontity.org/). You'll also be closer to, and more a part of, the Frontity community.

The latest news and announcements from Frontity can also be found in the community forum, as can the discussions on upcoming features. So by visiting it regularly you'll be fully up to speed on all things Frontity.

We look forward to welcoming you as a member of the [Frontity community forum](https://community.frontity.org/). See you there!
