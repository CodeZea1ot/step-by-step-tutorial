# Contributing to Frontity

As you're already aware, Frontity is open source and freely available for everyone.

We believe that open source is one of the most powerful ideas of our generation. It allows everyone to do things that otherwise they couldn't. Besides this, we believe that collaboration leads to a better development of technology.

There are many reasons to contribute to open source, one of which is that it will help make you a better developer. Check out our list of good reasons to contribute [here](https://docs.frontity.org/contributing#why-to-contribute).

## How you can contribute

You can contribute in many ways:

- contribute code to the Frontity framework
- testing and bug-fixing
- create themes/packages and share them on npmjs.com or github
- improve our docs (including this step-by-step tutorial!)
- help the community
- spread the word

### Contribute code

Frontity uses GitHub for managing the codebase. The repo can be found at [https://github.com/frontity/frontity](https://github.com/frontity/frontity).

Please see our [code contribution guide](https://docs.frontity.org/contributing/code-contribution-guide) for details of how you can contribute code to the Frontity framework.

To keep up to date with developments in Frontity and to see what's currently in development or being planned see the [feature discussions](https://community.frontity.org/c/feature-discussions/33). We welcome your input on any of the discussions there, or ideas for new features.

### Testing and bug-fixing

See the [repo](https://github.com/frontity/frontity) if you want to actively test the codebase or go bug-hunting. If you find a bug in your project development or use of Frontity you can [raise an issue](https://github.com/frontity/frontity/issues) or ask about it in the [community forum](https://community.frontity.org/).

### Create themes and packages

Frontity is designed to be modular in that packages can add new functionality, in the way that plugins do in WordPress, and themes can add a new presentation layer.

You've seen during this step-by-step tutorial how a new theme can be built from scratch.

There is already a good variety of themes and packages available on [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=frontity). If you are creating your own theme or package you can upload it to npmjs.com and make it available for the benefit of the whole Frontity development community. Plaudits and good karma will surely come your way!

### Improve the documentation

The Frontity documentation is also hosted on GitHub in [this repo](https://github.com/frontity/docs), and the step-by-step tutorial is in [this repo](https://github.com/frontity/step-by-step-tutorial).

If you spot any typos or errors, or have ideas for improving the docs please do raise an issue or a PR. Learn how you can contribute to the Frontity documentation [here](https://github.com/frontity/docs/wiki).

### Help the community

As previously mentioned the Frontity community can be found at [https://community.frontity.org/](https://community.frontity.org/). This is where you can ask questions and get solutions to your problems. It's also a great way to contribute, by helping others with their problems and sharing your knowledge for the benefit of others.

### Spread the word

And finally, another great way that you can contribute is by spreading the word about Frontity, being an evangelist, and raising awareness of Frontity in other developer communities, such as the WordPress community or the JavaScript and React communities.

You can do this in several ways:

- tweeting
- blogging
- speaking

#### Tweeting

The preferred social media platform for developers worldwide. Tweet about things you've built or shared or written (see below) related to Frontity. You could even tweet about a Frontity related article you've read, or a new release or new feature. It all helps to spread the word about Frontity.

Be sure to use the #frontity hashtag or mention @frontity if tweeting about Frontity.

#### Blogging

Share your knowledge by creating guides and tutorials that teach other developers about various aspects of working with Frontity. We're also interested in have guest bloggers on our own blog. Get in touch and tell us about your idea if you'd like to be a guest blogger for us.

Remember to tweet (see above) about your article.

#### Speaking

Talk about Frontity, a particular technical aspect of working with Frontity, or even your own experience of working with Frontity such as a project you've built or a technical problem you've overcome. Tech conferences (such as [WordCamps](https://central.wordcamp.org/)) and local MeetUp groups are always looking for speakers to talk on interesting topics.

As before remember to tweet about your talk.

#### Let us know

Do let us know about any articles you write or talks that you present. We'd love to hear about them and perhaps feature them in our newsletter.

## In conclusion
