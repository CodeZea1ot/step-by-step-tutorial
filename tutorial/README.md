## Welcome to the Frontity step-by-step tutorial

> _**[TO DO]** Remove warning banner above._

Welcome to the Frontity step-by-step tutorial.

This tutorial is a progressive sequence of lessons that will take you from first steps to mastery.

It will provide you with a solid foundation in developing websites with Frontity and will prepare you to better understand the rest of the Frontity documentation.

Since this is a progressive tutorial we recommend that you follow the lessons in sequence, as each lesson builds on what was learned earlier.

### The project

Frontity provides two themes to get you started, `mars-theme` and `twentytwenty`, and there are a host of third party themes on [_npmjs.com_](https://www.npmjs.com/) that you can install into your Frontity project. One of these could well fit your needs, but the best way to really understand Frontity and how it works is to build your own theme.

That is what we're going to do in this step-by-step tutorial. We'll start by installing Frontity, then go on to create a theme package and then develop a fully working and functional theme from scratch.

Along the way we'll cover a number of different topics, from listing posts, to displaying posts and pages, to styling our project and adding interactivity. We'll even make our project SEO friendly, refine it with some finishing touches, and make it work with Custom Post Types.

By the end you'll be a Frontity ninja! ðŸ¥·

Let's go! ðŸ‘‰
