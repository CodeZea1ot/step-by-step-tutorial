# Creating a custom theme

We'll start our journey to Frontity mastery by setting Frontity up from the command line. Later in this section we'll create a theme package and take our first baby steps in customising our new theme. ðŸ‘¶

But before we get started properly on the tutorial we just want to draw your attention to a small number of preliminary things.

### Check you're on the right track

For each step in this tutorial we have created a commit in [this repo](https://github.com/frontity-demos/tutorial-hello-frontity).

If you get stuck at any point you can compare your code at the relevant stage to [the commits in the repo](https://github.com/frontity-demos/tutorial-hello-frontity/commits/main).

In case you're not familiar with viewing [diffs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff) in a repo, you'll see something like this.

> Lines with a ðŸ”´ red background marked with a minus sign âž– are removed at that step.

> Lines with a ðŸŸ¢ green background marked with a plus sign âž• are added at that step.

At the end of each lesson (and sometimes within a lesson) you will see a box like this linking directly to the commit that has the changes in that lesson (or that part of the lesson).

{% hint style="success" %}
Check you're on the right track by comparing your changes with [the ones in this commit](#).
{% endhint %}

### The finished project

We'd really like you to see the project develop as you progress through the tutorial, so we're certainly not encouraging you to do this, but if you really do want to take a sneak peak at the finished project the final version can be seen in [this CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/frontity-demos/tutorial-hello-frontity).

### Other docs

This tutorial is intended as a didactic resource for those wishing to learn web development with Frontity. It is one part of a suite of documentation resources created by the Frontity team.

Other resources such as guides, core concepts, and reference resources can be found in the companion sites to this site:

- [**docs.frontity.org**](https://docs.frontity.org) - Introduction, concepts and guides
- [**api.frontity.org**](https://api.frontity.org) - API Reference

With these few preliminaries out of the way, we're ready to get started with learning Frontity. ðŸ‘‰
