# Creating a custom theme

We'll start our journey to Frontity mastery by setting Frontity up from the command line. We'll then create a theme package and take our first baby steps in customising our new theme.

In this first section we will:

- [Create a Frontity Project](./create-a-frontity-project.md)
- [Create a Theme Package](./create-a-theme-package.md)
- [Modify the `<Root>` component](./modify-the-root-component.md)
- [Connect the `<Root>` component to the state](./connect-the-root-component-to-the-state.md)
