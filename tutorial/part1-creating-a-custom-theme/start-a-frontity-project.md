# Start a Frontity Project

The first thing we are going to do is create a new Frontity project.

To do so, open up your terminal, navigate to the folder where you want to install your new project, and run this command:

```bash
npx frontity create hello-frontity
```

Select the `mars-theme` - it's the basic starter theme that we recommend for beginners.

When the install process finishes, you will have a new sub-folder called `hello-frontity` containing your project’s code.

Start a development server to check that everything is working:

```bash
cd hello-frontity
npx frontity dev
```

> `npx` downloads an npm package to run just this one time and then removes it from your computer. [learn more](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b)

Now open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser (if it didn't open automatically) to see your first Frontity project. At the moment it's using the "starter theme" that comes with Frontity, i.e. `@frontity/mars-theme`, and it is connected to a test WordPress site (https://test.frontity.org).

The next step is to change the project’s settings to point to the REST API of our own website (https://jsnation2020.frontity.org).
> *__[TO DO]__ ☝️ this url needs to change

- Open the file `frontity.settings.js` file. This file contains the configuration for the Frontity packages that you are using in your project.

- Change the value of the `url` field of the `@frontity/wp-source` package.

Replace this:
```js
state: {
  source: {
    url: "https://test.frontity.org"
  }
}
```
With this:
```js
state: {
  source: {
    url: "https://jsnation2020.frontity.org"
  }
}
```

This content set is useful for designing, creating and testing traditional PHP based WordPress themes, but we will find it useful for our purposes too.
