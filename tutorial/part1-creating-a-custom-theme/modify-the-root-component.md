# Modify the `<Root>` component

Let's continue by taking our initial baby steps in getting Frontity to display the content we want.

Modify the `<Root>` component in the `/packages/my-first-theme/src/index.js` file so that it returns an `<h1>` element containing the text ‚ÄúHello Frontity".

```jsx
// File: /packages/my-first-theme/src/index.js

const Root = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Hello Frontity</h1>
    </>
  )
}
```

Once you save the file you should see the content in the browser change.

{% hint style="info" %}
Webpack watches for changes in the `/packages` directory and refreshes the browser if it detects any changes. Since we have changed the content of a file within the `/packages` directory the content in the browser should automatically update.

It would be convenient, and make our codebase cleaner and more logical, and hence our future development much easier, if all our React components were placed together in a single directory. So, let's move the `<Root>` component into its own file which we'll put in a separate directory.

Create a new directory called `components` inside `/packages/my-first-theme/src`. This is where we will create all the component files for our theme. Then, inside `/packages/my-first-theme/src/components` create a new file called `index.js`.

Add the following code to the new file _(which we will henceforth refer to as the 'root component' file to distinguish it from the other `index.js` file in the `src` directory one level below in the structure)_.

```jsx
// File: /packages/my-first-theme/src/components/index.js

import React from "react"

const Root = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Hello Frontity</h1>
    </>
  )
}

export default Root
```

You will see that this is the same `<Root>` component as before but moved into the new file and then exported. We also need to import React into our new file.

We now need to import the component into the file `/packages/my-first-theme/src/index.js` which you can modify as follows:

```jsx
// File: /packages/my-first-theme/src/index.js

import Root from "./components"

const myFirstTheme = {
  name: "my-first-theme",
  roots: {
    theme: Root,
  },
  state: {
    theme: {},
  },
  actions: {
    theme: {},
  },
}

export default myFirstTheme
```

Save both files and make a quick check to see that everything is still working in the browser.
