# Adding behaviour

We've just seen an example of behaviour. We've made the styling of our site change depending on the type of page we are on.

In this section we're going to make our site respond to user actions in a more direct way. We'll see how we can use properties in the state and actions, working together in tandem, to make our site interactive.

After that we'll go on to implement a key feature of any blog based website, i.e. the ability to paginate through the post listing.

By the end of this section our site will not only be looking good, but it will also have useful functionality added to it.
