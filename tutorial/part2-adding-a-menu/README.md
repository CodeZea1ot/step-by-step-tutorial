# Adding a menu

We've now got the beginnings of our project up and running and we've created the directory structure that we're going to work in going forward.

We've also seen how we can change the value stored in `state.router.link` by manually changing the URL in the browser's address bar.

In this second section we will create a basic menu consisting of a series of links that ultimately will enable us to navigate around our site, but for now will change the URL (and hence the value stored in `state.router.link`) for us.

To do so we will learn about and use one of the built-in components that Frontity provides, i.e. the `<Link>` component.
